# Week 3: Extended Project
## Web Server

Build a simple HTTP server in Ruby

## Instructions

- Make teams of 2-3 people for this project.
- The code should be uploaded to github and show the history of all your commits

## Acceptance Criteria

- Your server needs to respond to GET requests
- Have an html homepage in `/` greeting the visitor and telling more about who is on your team and what is Codeable for you
- For any request not specified above search for a file with the same name as the path in `./public` and reply with the content (eg. `/hi.html` should reply with the content of `./public/hi.html`)
- For every member in your team, create a webpage displaying more information about you and serve it at `/?member=name` where `name` should be replaced by your team member's name.
- You will be creating a ***user guide*** for yourself, explaining to others what's the best way to work with you. These are so,e of the questions:
  - What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
  - What drives you nuts?
  - How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
  - What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
  - What's the best way to convince you to do something?
  - How do you like to get feedback?
- There needs to be at least as many _pull requests_ as members in your team.
